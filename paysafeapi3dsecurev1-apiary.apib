# Overview 

A transaction using Verified by Visa or MasterCard SecureCode will initiate a redirection to the website of the card issuing bank to authorize the transaction. Each issuing bank could use any kind of authentication method (the protocol does not cover this) but typically, a password-based method is used. So to effectively buy on the Internet means using a password tied to the card. The Verified by Visa protocol recommends the bank's verification page to load in an [inline frame](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Frames) session. In this way, the bank's systems can be held responsible for most security breaches.

**Note:** 3D Secure is currently supported for Visa and MasterCard brands only. Contact your account manager for more information.

The steps in 3D Secure cardholder authentication are shown below. For a detailed description, see the [Introduction to 3D Secure](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/rest-api/3ds/getting-started/introduction-to-3d-secure/).

# Authentication

In order for you to use the Paysafe REST API, Paysafe must first set you up on their system and provide you with an API key. Your API key looks something like this:

  * Key Username – MerchantXYZ
  * Key Password – B-tst1-0-51ed39e4-312d02345d3f123120881dff9bb4020a89e8ac44cdfdcecd702151182fdc952272661d290ab2e5849e31bb03deede7e

**Note:** This is not the same as your Merchant Back Office username and password.

The case-sensitive API key is sent using HTTP Basic Authentication. To use HTTP Basic Authentication, you must send the API key credentials using the Authorization header with every request. The Authorization header is constructed as follows:

1. The Key Username and Key Password are combined into a string separated by a colon, e.g.,“Key Username:Key Password”.

2. The resulting string literal is then encoded using Base64.

3. The authorization method and a space (i.e., “Basic”) are then put before the encoded string.

For example, using the Key Username and Password examples above, the header is formed as follows:

``Authorization: Basic
TWVyY2hhbnRYWVo6Qi10c3QxLTAtNTFlZDM5ZTQtMzEyZDAyMzQ1ZDNmMTIzMTIwODgxZGZmOWJiNDAyMGE4OWU4YWM0NGNkZmRjZWNkNzAyMTUxMTgyZmRjOTU yMjcyNjYxZDI5MGFiMmU1ODQ5ZTMxYmIwM2RlZWRlN2U=``

For additional details, please refer to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).

**Note:** Your Production API key will be different from your Test API key. Contact your account manager for details. You must keep your API keys safe and ensure that it is used appropriately for your needs.

# API

The 3D Secure API allows merchants to verify whether a credit card being used for an online transaction is registered in the 3D Secure program, and, if it is, to then use 3D Secure to authenticate that card. The REST protocol uses JSON for all requests and responses.

The following request types are supported: 

  * [Enrollment Lookups](#enrollmentlookup)
  * [Authentications](#authenticationrequest)

# Getting Started

You can use the 3D Secure REST APIs to verify whether a credit card is enrolled for the 3D Secure service, and then, if it is, to authenticate that credit card when it is being used for an online purchase request. This enables you to process transactions through the Card Payments API that are fully 3D Secure. Click [here](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/rest-api/3ds/using-the-api/scenarios/) for descriptions of the main scenarios.

# Testing Instructions

The Paysafe Test environment can be used to test websites or applications without actually running transactions through a live 3D Secure service. It is important to make sure that your systems are working correctly before going into a live environment. Click [here](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/rest-api/3ds/test-and-go-live/testing-instructions/) for details of how to use the test environment.

## card

When providing card information, merchants can provide either card details or a payment token for a customer already created in the system. 3D Secure is currently supported for Visa and MasterCard brands only; contact your account manager for more information.

## 3D Secure Errors
If an error occurs during the 3D Secure processing at Visa, MasterCard, or the Issuer, this will not be reported directly to the merchant. Instead the 3D Secure process will continue as normally as possible. For example:
  * If an error occurs within the directory server the *threeDEnrollment* field will indicate "U" and no ACS URL will be returned.
  * If an error occurs during the Authentication, a *PaRes* will be returned as normal, with the error indicated within, along with a *threeDResult* of "U".

In the event of an error, it is up to the merchant whether they wish to proceed with the card authorization. Please see [3D Secure Results](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/rest-api/3ds/test-and-go-live/3d-secure-results/) for more information. 

# Using the example API calls (Console Window)
To configure and test the API examples, first click on one of the API calls in the API Reference section and then click **Switch to Console** in the right hand pane. 
Using the Console window you can update the headers, the request body, and parts of the API endpoint. 
For example, for many requests you must update the endpoint to include your account ID, which you do by selecting **URI Parameters** and then updating the **ACCOUNT_ID** value. 
(To get your account ID, log into the Paysafe Back Office, choose **Accounts** and look in the *Account* column).
You must also update the Header to include your API Key by selecting **Headers** and then updating the **Authorization** value using the Base64
version of your API key. To get your API key, log into the test version of the Merchant Back Office and choose **Settings > API Key**. 
Click *View Base 64 Encoded* and copy the key to your clipboard. Paste the key after the word Basic to replace the text YOUR-BASE64-ENCODED-API-KEY.
When you are ready to test your example, you can choose between the Production and Mock server environment:
* Production server – This calls the resource on Paysafe's Test system. 
* Mock server – This environment simply returns the dummy values in the example response irrespective of the parameters you supply. You do not need to use your account ID or Test API key for this request.

To call the API resource, click **Call Resource**. The response is displayed in the Console window.Minor 

## Verify the Service is Accessible [GET /monitor]

This call returns a status of READY if the API is available.

# Enrollment Lookups [/enrollmentchecks]
<a name="enrollmentlookup"></a>

## Enrollment Lookup [POST /v1/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/enrollmentchecks]

This is how you do an Enrollment Lookup. You must then POST the paReq value from the lookup response to the acsURL, also from the response, together with the merchant response URL (TermUrl) for card authentication. The payment response (paRes) generated during authentication is then posted to the TermUrl.
